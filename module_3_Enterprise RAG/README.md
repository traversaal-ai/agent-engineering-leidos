# Module 3: Enterprise RAG

Meet **Alex**, an assistant you can take apart. Alex runs at four levels, and each
level turns on exactly one more capability, so you can watch a plain language
model become a grounded enterprise assistant one piece at a time.

`LLM -> Chatbot -> Tool-Using Agent -> RAG-Enabled Assistant`

The point of this module is not that RAG is impressive. It is that RAG is
**string concatenation with a search step in front of it**, and this app is built
so you can prove that to yourself rather than take it on faith.

## The four levels

| Level | What gets turned on | What you should notice |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | LLM only | Ask a question, then ask a follow-up. It has no idea what you just said. The payload really does contain one message. |
| **2** | + conversation history | Follow-ups work now. Nothing was "remembered" — the whole transcript is re-sent every single turn, and it grows. |
| **3** | + web search tool | Alex decides for itself whether it needs to search. The result comes back as **text**, appended to the same message list, and the whole thing is sent again. |
| **4** | + retrieval (RAG) | Excerpts from your documents are pasted into the system prompt. Alex answers from them first and only searches the web when they fall short. |

The levels are strictly cumulative. Level 4 still has Level 3's `web_search`
tool. Bracket citations like `[1]` mean the answer came from a document;
markdown links mean it came from the web.

## The two things to actually show people

**The debug panel** (sidebar checkbox) is the teaching surface, not a developer
tool. It shows the literal payload sent to the model for every turn of the
session, rendered as a conversation, with each message tagged:

- `appended this turn` — the message you just typed
- `re-sent from earlier turns` — history, replayed because the model forgot it
- `produced during this turn` — a tool request and its result
- `sent on every call` — the system prompt

Ask the same two questions at Level 1 and at Level 2, then compare the payloads
side by side. Watch the character count go from 69 to 242 to 8,000+. That is the
entire lesson about context, and nobody has to believe you — it is on screen.

The panel also splits the system prompt into its two halves:

| | What it is | Who wrote it |
|---|---|---|
| **Prompt engineering** | Alex's persona, the grounding rules, the citation rules | Us, by hand, identical on every call |
| **Context engineering** | The retrieved excerpts | Nobody — looked up per question and pasted in |

**"How RAG works"** (button at Level 4) walks through chunking, weighting, and
retrieval on the real index. Every number in it is read live from the running
system:

1. Pick a document.
2. See it cut into chunks, with the overlapping text between them highlighted.
3. See each chunk turned into the numbers a model actually compares — the
   vector it was embedded into.
4. Type a question and watch all ~780 chunks get scored and ranked, with the
   losers labelled `cut by top-k` or `below threshold`.

## The knowledge base

Two kinds of source, indexed together:

- `Project-Management-2nd-Edition-1729807212.pdf` — a general project management
  reference. Long prose, 740 chunks, cut into overlapping windows.
- `data/*.md` — a fictional **ACME Aerospace Systems** program: master services
  agreement, statement of work, two sets of meeting notes, and a risk register.
  Short, structured, one chunk per section.

> The ACME documents are **invented sample data**, labelled as such in every
> file. They exist so the demo answers questions a program team would really
> ask — *"what are the payment terms?"*, *"what is the highest risk right
> now?"* — instead of textbook definitions.

They interlock on purpose. A late deliverable shows up as an action item in the
kickoff notes, an escalation in the status review, and risk R-02 in the
register, so follow-up questions have to chain across documents.

Drop any `.md` or `.txt` file into `data/`, re-run `python backend/build_index.py`,
and it joins the index.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` — Anthropic answers,
OpenAI embeds. `TAVILY_API_KEY` is optional; without it, web search returns
clearly-labelled mock results and the UI says so.

Then build the retrieval index, once:

```bash
python backend/build_index.py
```

`index/` is gitignored — 12MB of vectors that change whenever the documents do —
so a fresh clone starts without one and Level 4 has nothing to retrieve from.
The app says as much on startup, naming this exact command. Re-run it whenever
`data/` or the PDF changes.

To build it without an OpenAI key, use the offline model instead — it needs
`pip install -r search-lab/requirements.txt` for torch, and the app must then
also run with `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=local`. An index is only searchable by the
model that built it — different models produce unrelated vectors, so `rag.py`
refuses the mismatch rather than returning quiet nonsense:

```bash
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=local python backend/build_index.py
```

## Run

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000.

The document index builds on a background thread at startup, so the app is
usable immediately. `GET /api/health` reports when it is ready.

## Deployed

| | |
|---|---|
| Assistant | https://alex-enterprise-rag.vercel.app |
| Search Lab | https://alex-enterprise-rag.vercel.app/lab |

Both sit behind one password, because live Anthropic, OpenAI and Tavily keys sit
behind them and an open URL is an open invitation to spend someone else's
credits. `APP_PASSWORD` mints a signed cookie; without it every `/api/` route
returns 401, including the chat stream. One login covers both apps.

The gate is deliberately off locally — `APP_PASSWORD` is unset in `.env`, so
nothing asks you for a password while you are building.

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Try these

| Level | Ask this | Then this |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | What is the capital of France? | What city did I just ask about? |
| 2 | (same two) | Notice the second one works now — and why |
| 3 | What's happening in Boston this weekend? | Check whether the pill says **live** or **mocked** |
| 4 | What are the payment terms in the ACME contract? | What is the highest risk on the Sentinel program? |
| 4 | What is the weather right now? | Documents can't answer, so it searches the web |
| 4 | Who won the most recent Super Bowl? | Same fallback, different citation style |

## Also in this module: Search Lab

[`search-lab/`](search-lab/) is a frontend for
[`basic_keyword_semantic_search.py`](basic_keyword_semantic_search.py): keyword
retrieval and semantic retrieval, running side by side on the same documents for
the same question.

```bash
uvicorn --app-dir search-lab app:app --port 8010
```

Its own app, its own port. In the deployment it is served at
[`/lab`](https://alex-enterprise-rag.vercel.app/lab) rather than as a second
Vercel project, because a project's bundle cannot reach above its root and the
lab imports this module's embeddings provider. It is deployable at all because
`EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` defaults to `openai`; the offline nomic model drags in
~525MB of torch, far past the function size limit. Locally either works.

Ask it `feline hunting rodents` and keyword search returns **nothing** while
nomic-embed-text finds the right document instantly. Ask `cat that chases mouse`
and keyword search returns the *wrong* document confidently. That gap is the
argument for everything below.

## What is deliberately naive

Worth saying out loud when you teach this, because the gap between this and a
production system is the interesting part:

- **No reranker.** Top-k by cosine similarity against one threshold, nothing
  more. No cross-encoder, no query rewriting, no hybrid keyword-plus-vector
  scoring — all three are standard in production and all three are absent.
- **No evaluation harness.** Faithfulness, coverage, and hallucination rates
  are exactly what Week 6 is about.
- **The vector store is a numpy matrix**, loaded from a JSON file and searched
  by one dot product against all 780 chunks. No Pinecone, no Chroma, no FAISS —
  on purpose, so nothing is hidden behind a service. It is also why the corpus
  size is the limit: this approach stops being reasonable a couple of orders of
  magnitude from here.
- **Chunking is fixed-size**, ~900 characters with 150 of overlap, blind to
  headings, tables and sentence boundaries. A clause split down the middle is
  retrieved as two half-answers.
